 And explained what it was that a b.j meant 
 His stories were dark and deep like 
 His eyes your eyes so full of secrets 
 I guess I loved you right when 
 My mom said your mom's a lesbian 
 It's been so long I probably wouldn't know you 
 If I saw you again 
 I folowed eric, second through fifth grade 
 His raspy voice down the long hallway 
 He liked the dirty drawings I made 
 Girls with impossible breasts 
 I tried to sell him one for fifty cents, 
 Now they're in the back of mrs. Waltz's desk 
 And I hope I never see that boy again. 
 Young love is in the air 
 Young love is cheap, I mean, it's everywhere 
 This ain't no statement of knowledge 
 It's just my defense 
 I've been ignoring the cost 
 Is this love is this love that I've lost? 
 Worst of all ain't nothing big ain't nothing big 
 About this at all 
 Honey, I don't want to 
 Be ok with never 
 Seeing you again 
 You kids on the boardwalk 
 Come back in 
 To the dry, choked up land 
 I want truth and beauty 
 I want to love someone simply 
 I want truth and beauty 
 I want to love something 
 Without it having to need me 
 Beauty 
 I want love someone 
 I want to truth and beauty 
 I want to love something without it having to",0.09,0.646,0.265,0.9952

 So I followed it downstairs 
 Saw my mom on the couch

 The sound of the chopper flying low 
 We didn't know why it was coming 
 Then they called with the 
 Chicken in the oven 
 It was the chaplain, he said 
 You came in with your 
 Jaw torn, still talking 
 I found you in the hospital asleep 
 I wonder which one of us 
 Looked stranger then 
 Once I thought 
 Being lost was only a part of 
 Being young 
 But the old man in the bed 
 Next to your cot 
 Was screaming lounder than anyone 
 Saying, mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! 
 Little white mice 
 Run across my bed while 
 The nurses play poker outside 
 Oh, my God!

 Those come-what-may places 
 Where one relaxes on the axis 
 Of the wheel of life 
 To get the feel of life 
 From jazz and cocktails 
 The gals I knew had sad and sullen gray faces 
 With distingué traces 
 That used to be there 
 You could see where 
 They'd been washed away 
 By too many through the day 
 Twelve o'clock tales 
 Then you came along 
 With your siren song 
 To tempt me to madness 
 I thought for awhile 
 That your poignant smile 
 Was tinged with the sadness 
 Of a great love for me 
 I guess I was wrong 
 Again, I was wrong 
 Life is lonely again 
 And only last year everything seemed so sure 
 Now life is awful again 
 A troughful of hearts could only be a bore 
 A week in Paris might ease the bite of it 
 All I care is to smile in spite of it 
 I'll forget you I will 
 While yet you are still 
 Burning inside my brain 
 Romance is mush 
 Stifling those who strive 
 I'll live a lush life 
 In some small dive 
 And there I'll be 
 While I rot with the rest 
 Of those whose lives are lonely, too 
 Lush life",0.144,0.734,0.122,-0.4604

 There were no fish swimming in my sea 
 I resided myself to the fact 
 That I would always love never to be loved back 
 But that's okay, I know some day 
 When the sun has set, I will go dig up the dead 
 Lift their bodies from their graves 
 And I'll lay them in my bed 
 To fill their hollow hearts with all of my broken parts 
 And all the love they were never shown 
 To all those who have lived and died alone 
 I guess I thought it couldn't really hurt 
 To search for sweethearts underneath the dirt 
 Sure, they may be made of dust and bone 
 But I will take them home from their lonely tombstone 
 To be with me in the Dead Sea 
 When the sun has set, I will go dig up the dead 
 Lift their bodies from their graves 
 And I'll lay them in my bed 
 To fill their hollow hearts with all of my broken parts 
 And all the love they were never shown 
 To all those who have lived and died alone

 You're a long shot

 Because you forgot!

 Of no truck

 Without getting caught 
 Babe you better go 
 Get in line

 Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes

 Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall

 There is a voice inside us all 
 So smile when you can, when you can 
 How this used to feel so far and free 
 Now these broken souls are all I see 
 Fists have fallen to our side 
 We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed 
 But my mama said- 
 Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall 
 (Oh I, nah, nah, nah) 
 If you are strong you cannot fall 
 (If you are strong) 
 There is a voice inside us all 
 So smile when you can, when you can 
 If you cannot, oh! 
 There is more to you and me 
 There is more than they can see 
 I'm on your side (Woo, oh!) 
 There is more out there 
 And somebody cares 'bout you 
 I do

 Pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down 
 We're here tonight for a very special offering 
 An offering of our spirits this evening in unison 
 But first a word of instruction 
 Hello, hello 
 Please leave all your belongings at the door 
 You can sit or stand, we can take a vote 
 And just tiptoe to the center of the circle 
 While we unveil the ropes 
 Still a little room left to hang your clothes 
 Some of us are new here, we'll take it slow 
 Ready, set, go 
 I lock hands with yours 
 We dive into the floor 
 When we reach the core 
 Then we stomp some more 
 I lock hands with yours 
 And then we dive down into the floor 
 Seven thousand miles till we reach the core 
 And then we circle back and we stomp some more 
 Got it? 
 It's just like that 
 You promise all your life, then you turn your back 
 You glide across the space, and diagonal past 
 Then you kick, and you jump, and you arch your back 
 You move your hips and your arms like a cat 
 Spin three times, and you're back where you're at 
 Does anybody catch what any of this is about? 
 No? Well, work it out 
 Zebra Katz: 
 Out of body from morning to night 
 Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling all right 
 Out of body from morning to night 
 Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling all right 
 Out of body from morning to night 
 Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling all right 
 Out of body from morning to night 
 Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling all right 
 Kilo Kish: 
 Okay 
 Slide like a lizard, bark with the crowd 
 Eyes dilated, dark to the grass 
 Then when you find you're invisible 
 You melt into a puzzle 
 Keep it flowing like the rivers do 
 You gotta pay attention to the motion of the fish 
 Stay within the school or you're surely gonna miss 
 And if you lose your way, it's a cold black abyss 
 Don't take the chance, not worth the risk 
 Zebra Katz: 
 Out of body from morning to night 
 Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling all right 
 Out of body from morning to night 
 Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling all right

 There's always stains on what's real and true 
 Tonight is a special, special occasion 
 And all that's left for us to do, is move

 Attention seeker, public speaker 
 Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely 
 Writin' songs about these people 
 Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony 
 One thing I know, is that I wanna 
 Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago 
 Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low 
 You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo 
 From the start it's been real dark 
 It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh 
 I'm playin' like Hasbro 
 I'm really Saari, call me Arto 
 Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla 
 I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt) 
 But what the fuck else do you want from me? 
 That is the only thing keepin' me company 
 Purchase some things until I'm annoyed 
 These items is fillin' the void 
 Been fillin' it for so long 
 I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (oh) 
 Current battle as an adult 
 My partner is a shadow 
 I need love, do you got some I could borrow? 
 Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow 
 But that never comes 
 Like a vasectomy, what have I done? 
 I got the talent, the face and the funds 
 Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who) 
 Mirror, mirror on the wall (who) 
 The loneliest of them all (me) 
 Cupid actin' stupid 
 Do you got another number I could call? 
 Never had a pet 
 I've never had a pet 
 There's more fish in the sea 
 But I never had a goldfish to begin with 
 I never had a dog 
 So I've never been good with bitches 
 'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch 
 I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet 
 Treat me like direct deposit 
 Check in on me sometime

 You used to know everything 
 You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you 
 You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too 
 Your big brother foot work 
 Your play sister Juke 
 The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you 
 As you were for me, to worry 'bout Frooties and Trues 
 Till I found out all of the shawtys with cooties was cute 
 And realized what booties could do 
 We gon' get it poppin' 
 We gon' get it Jukin' 
 We gon' throw a party 
 And we ain't gotta do shit 
 You came with your best friend 
 Came up for the weekend 
 Rolling with your party 
 So tell me what you thinkin' 
 Say we gon' have a juke jam 
 We gon' have a juke jam 
 We can have a party, just listening to music 
 Like we used to do 
 I'll get close to you 
 I remember you 
 You used to, I remember you 'cause 
 We've got so much history baby (juke) 
 Maybe (juke) 
 Maybe you and I were meant to be 
 Maybe (juke) 
 I'm crazy (juke) 
 We never rolled at the rink 
 We would just go to the rink 
 You ain't buy tokens no more 
 You just hip roll at the rink 
 You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him 
 But when they play ""Take You Down"", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in 
 I mean it's just dancing 
 It's harmless as fuck 
 Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up 
 Then we hit the floor 
 All the kiddies stopped skating 
 To see grown folks do, what grown folks do 
 When they grown and they dating 
 We've got so much history baby, maybe 
 Maybe you and I were meant to be 
 Maybe, I'm crazy 
 Crazy about you 
 We gon' get it poppin' 
 We gon' get it Jukin' 
 We gon' throw a party 
 And we ain't gotta do shit 
 You came with your best friend 
 Came up for the weekend 
 Rollin' with your party

 Gotta get this paper, get this cake up 
 Gotta do my hair, gotta put on make-up 
 Gotta act like I care about this fake stuff 
 Straight up 
 What a waste of my day 
 If I had it my way 
 I'd roll out of bed 
 Say bout 2:30 mid day 
 Hit the blunt then hit you up to come over to my place 
 You show up right away 
 We make love and then we fuck 
 And then you give me my space 
 Hey 
 What I am trying to say is 
 The love is ours to make so we should make it 
 Everything else can wait 
 The time is ours to take so we should take it 
 Wake up, wake up, bake up 
 Gotta heat the vape up 
 Let's get faded 
 Better call your job tell em' you won't make it 
 Ain't nobody here baby let's get wasted 
 We should just get naked 
 'Cause I've been working hard and I know you be on the same shit 
 Every other day's a different game that you just can't win 
 I just wanna ease your mind and make you feel all right 
 So go head tell your baby mama you gon' be with me tonight 
 Right 
 What I am trying to say is 
 The love is ours to make so we should make it 
 Everything else can wait 
 The time is ours to take so we should take it 
 It's not love, but it's pretty close 
 Hot fudge and a little smoke 
 I didn't mean it means nothing to you 
 Hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do 
 Can't stop on cloud 20 
 Buried in the drugs, but the feels keeps coming 
 Finally stop crying, but your nose is still running 
 Wipe it on my shirt, ha ha on the sleeve 
 You tell me that you wanna do it big 
 I love when you say ""guess what?"" (what? What?) 
 Reading stories to some other nigga kid 
 And I wonder why I'm all messed up (up up up up) 
 'Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes 
 Be a class act, never mind my alumni 
 I don't wanna be around a baby so dumb high 
 That I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides 
 Curled up with my head on your chest 
 It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress 
 If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed 
 It'll be like this to the kiss of the death 
 Of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no 
 Not a good team, one soul, two halves 
 No joke, who laughs? 
 Just us (just us, just us) 
 Okay, got this oj and jose 
 Mixed it up with that rosé 
 We gon' do this our own way 
 All right, okay 
 What is it that you're smoking? 
 Piece it up with this peace and love 
 And this peace and love like the old days 
 What I am trying to say is 
 The love is ours to make so we should make it 
 Everything else can wait 
 The time is ours to take so we should take it 
 We should stay right here 
 We should lay right here

 Rolling when you ride 
 Ride the Rodman 
 Got one that's straight acting 
 Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)

 2017 ideas playing off a Walkman

 With a cup in a cup, Actavis

 I need that bitch to grind on my belt

 Yeah, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope 
 Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope 
 I don't want no picture with the president 
 I just wanna talk to the man 
 Speak for the boys in the bando 
 And my nigga never walkin' again 
 Apologized if I'm harpin' again 
 I know these things happen often 
 But I'm back on the scene 
 I was lost in a dream as I write this 
 The team down in Austin 
 I been buildin' me a house 
 Back home in the South, ma 
 Won't believe what it's costin' 
 And it's fit for a king, right? 
 Or a nigga that could sing 
 And explain all the pain that it cost him 
 My sixteen should've came with a coffin 
 Fuck the fame and the fortune-well, maybe not the fortune 
 But one thing is for sure though, the fame is exhaustin' 
 That's why I moved away, I needed privacy 
 Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League 
 Students that's recruited highly 
 Thinkin' you do you and I do me 
 Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard 
 My niggas stand outside and pass cigars 
 Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard 
 Thankful that they friend's a platinum star 
 In the driveway there's no rapper cars 
 Just some shit to get from back and forth 
 Just some shit to get from back and forth 
 Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure 
 We'll help you if you've felt too insecure 
 To be the star you always knew you were 
 Wait, I think police is at the door 
 Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope 
 Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope sellin' dope 
 The neighbors think I'm-neighbors think I'm- 
 (Don't follow me, don't follow me...) 
 I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope 
 (Don't follow me, don't follow me...) 
 I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope 
 Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope 
 Well motherfucker, I am 
 Some things you can't escape; death, taxes, and a ra- 
 -Cist society that make every nigga feel like a candidate 
 For a Trayvon kinda fate, even when your crib sit on a lake 
 Even when your plaques hang on a wall 
 Even when the president jam your tape 
 Took a little break just to annotate 
 How I feel, damn it's late 
 I can't sleep 'cause I'm paranoid 
 Black in a white man territory 
 Cops bust in with the army guns 
 No evidence of the harm we done 
 Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang 
 Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn 
 Don't follow me, don't follow me 
 Don't follow me, don't follow me 
 Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope 
 Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope 
 The neighbors think I'm... neighbors think I'm- 
 (Don't follow me, don't follow me...) 
 I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope 
 (Don't follow me, don't follow me...) 
 I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope 
 Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope 
 Well motherfucker, I am 
 I am, I am, I am, I am 
 Well motherfucker, I am 
 I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope 
 I am, I am, I am 
 Well motherfucker, I am

 Don't know what I was thinkin' 
 I'm movin' back to Southside 
 So much for integration

 Could be winter but I burn inside

 Walking on the pavement I check my pride and my teeth on 
 The girl I grew up with lives a couple houses down 
 The 8 Bus run the same, dogs howl when the train 
 Comes like me ex girl and next girl 
 Used to rock the S curl 
 Wanted me a Nextel but my momma copped a Razr 
 That's why I couldn't blame her 
 Flipping through my past like I used to flip the phone 
 They kicking out the blacks and all the houses getting clones 
 Friends used to do pills and only eat at Du's Grill 
 The food was pretty good but the times was better 
 These are the only days I missed 
 Like the first shawty I kissed 
 I used to have dreams now I dream 
 I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood 
 Not satisfied don't think I ever wanna stay for good 
 Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I gotta go, go 
 And once I do they'll finally see the inner me 
 Everybody wanna be a star, everybody want a nice car 
 Everybody wanna live great, have a good damn time, never trip with the law 
 The popo up in PO, dirtier than VO 
 Bullies from the past act like I'm they fucking hero 
 Living in LA for the weather, I facetime mom when I miss her 
 I got some homies that'll never leave my home 
 When I pull up to the corner, it smell like Miley Cyrus 
 I told 'em I don't smoke, they say ""boy, you fucking wildin'"" 
 Innocent and young, reckless and we dumb 
 Our heart is like our earth and memories the sun 
 I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood 
 Not satisfied don't think I ever wanna stay for good 
 Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I gotta go, go 
 And once I do they'll finally see the inner me 
 Mentality the same from my folks 
 Momma wanna see me happy, she don't wanna see me broke 
 I said ""bread wine, sauvignon, rastafari, babylon"" 
 You can never die if I live it like a prize (hey!) 
 Who knows who I am, who knows who I are 
 Most people pretty sketch like a night at Echo Park 
 That's why I just keep it cool but my time is in a leisure 
 Every time I'm home I catch emotion like a seizure 
 I cut the first night, we fuck around, I put my finger in her bootyhole cause you know you gotta test the water with hoes. A-a-and then... 
 I slip and slide through the times in my youth 
 What's the age? Too young to worry, too old to dream 
 What's the age? Imagination to me, tragedy to some 
 What's the age? I guess we'll find out when we're older. Touché 
 I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood 
 Not satisfied don't think I ever wanna stay for good 
 Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I gotta go, go 
 And once I do they'll finally see the inner me

 I want you now not whenever 
 'Cause I want to give you better 
 But Baby it's whatever 
 Somebody gotta step up 
 Girl I'm that somebody 
 So I'm next up 
 Be damned if I let him catch up 
 It's easy to see that you're fed up 
 I am on a whole 'nother level 
 He only treated you like a trophy, not a gold medal 
 Fuck 'em girl I guess he didn't know any better 
 Girl that man didn't show any effort 
 Do all I can just to show you you're special 
 Certainly with trust we can get this together 
 And Lately you say he been killing the vibe 
 But you still role with him, why? 
 Pull up, skurt 
 Get in the ride 
 Left hand is steering the other is gripping your thigh 
 Stop playing games cause you mine 
 Shawty you deserve what you been missing 
 Baby no more games I'm down for business 
 Play this song for him tell him just listen 
 Don't

 Don't 
 Girl, said he keeps on playing games and his loving ain't the same 
 I don't know what to say-ay but 
 What a shame 
 If you were mine you would not get the same 
 If you were mine you would top everything 
 Suicide in the drop switching lanes 
 And that thang so fire baby no propane 
 Got good pussy girl can I be frank 
 To keep it 100 girl I ain't no saint 
 But he the only reason that I'm feeling this way 
 Giving you the world baby when you get space

 Get it on your own or I can't respect it 
 See me in person, don't call, don't text it 
 Show a lot of love to my people, I don't post it 
 Y'all don't gotta know, just as long as they know it 
 Despite your efforts, I'm here and I always will be 
 No rap name to hide behind, this the real me 
 Before the plaques, I was certified 
 I do business, I keep my income diversified 
 I counted 35 thousand with my family last night 
 And another 35 before this verse

 Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, then he got his back wet

 Frontin' with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet 
 All my niggas from street, they a nigga best yes

 Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk 
 Did it, got away with it out the Civic

 Shit just got real, things are getting intense now 
 I hear you talkin' 'bout we a lot, oh, you speak French now? 
 Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now 
 I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?"" 
 On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now 
 You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now 
 It's after 2AM and that's asking a lot of you right now 
 All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once 
 Come and see me for once 
 You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me 
 All she ever say is come and see me for once 
 Come and see me for once 
 You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me 
 I been up for two whole days thinking what I did to keep you going 
 Thumbing through the voicemails that you left me 
 Telling me where I went wrong 
 I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry 
 Things change, people change, feelings change too 
 Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you 
 You said you never traded no, yeah you said that 
 And I believed you when they told me don't 
 Yeah thought you meant that 
 But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you 
 Swear these days all you say is come and see me for once 
 Come and see me for once 
 You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me 
 All she hit me with is come and see me for once 
 Come and see me for once 
 You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me 
 Why you gotta start girl, why you gotta start? 
 I know we make time for the things that we want 
 I know you got another nigga tryna play the part 
 Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart 
 Could be standing in a field, and he still ain't in the field 
 If anything should change then I thought we had a deal 
 Lately you keep questioning what you get out the deal 
 Doing things to make me feel the way I make you feel 
 How hard is it to let you know when I'm coming home 
 That way you can be prepared 
 Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay 
 I don't even know what things are looking 
 Like inside of your place and how it's decorated 
 This thing is getting one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now 
 All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once 
 Come and see me for once 
 You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me 
 All she hit me with is come and see me for once 
 Come and see me for once

 (I love you...) 
 The story of a boy who chased the sunset until it chased him 
 (Where you goin'?) 
 Never quite sure about his placement 
 Or where he's been in this pink world 
 Or why nothing ever made sense 
 He knew that he had loved and had been loved 
 But had no chronological order to place it 
 (So confusing...) 
 All he knew was that he woke up everyday 
 Bleeding with amnesia and the case of new memories 
 That he had tendencies to mistake for fiction 
 (She saw...) 
 So everyday he journeyed to the mountain to recover his past 
 In order to understand his future 
 (I can't remember all this...) 
 She loves him but she eventually killed him 
 (Pow, pow, pow, pow...) 
 Now listen, Syre was a mischief with a vision 
 But his most poetic trait was his wisdom 
 (Where you goin'?) 
 His mind was as bright and as pink as the city that he lived in 
 And the only kids that could live in this bliss 
 Were the outcasts, the misfits 
 (Why did you leave?) 
 Those were his companions 
 Even though they could never understand his struggles 
 Through these harsh lands 
 He gave them the upper hand of his emotional tantrums 
 Syre-passion, pain and desire 
 Just like my big bro 
 What you didn't know is this young kid's been in limbo 
 Since that gunshot wound on that hidden road 
 Lost, broken, invisible 
 But when that light gets slow he's invincible 
 (Time...) 
 So much so, that he redefines inevitable, so it'll never go 
 (Brace yourself...) 
 It seems as though the sun wouldn't set at all 
 Instead of setting slow 
 She lies to him and said she'd never let him go 
 (You're a liar...) 
 And as the legend goes 
 Syre lived forever on and never and forever alone 
 (Syre...) 
 Syre (I can't remember all this, I love you...)

 Take me home with you 
 Change my taste in music 
 ( 
 I'm fallen 
 ) Make me rise with you 
 ( 
 She likes me 
 ) I'm surprised you do 
 Look, your love's like a river, bae, I've seen better days, yeah 
 And my soul, you penetrate, I need your energy 
 Vibrations make me levitate, sipping Hennessy 
 Reading bell hooks, she just sayin' 
 I'm surprised you do ( 
 baby 
 ) 
 I won't lie to you ( 
 I love you 
 ) 
 I'm your guy who's new 
 Hide me from the blue 
 I'm dying on the moon 
 And I just needed you 
 Baby, you are so unusual like cutting cuticles 
 But that is just what makes you beautiful 
 Like watching tulips grow 
 When you walk, it's just slow motion baby 
 Why you moving slow? 
 And when you talk, I got my lasers on you like a UFO 
 Girl your eyes are like the open sea, the simple poetry 
 This whole generation, O.M.G, I see your soul, it's older 
 We should build a city overseas, this country kinda cold 
 I mean they feed the children dopamine 
 And leave them on the sofa 
 I mean, ah, I need someone to renounce with, whoa 
 Ice bucket challenge in the fountain, whoa 
 Chance of finding you, one in a hundred thousand, whoa 
 I just wanna kiss you on the mountain, whoa 
 Spend some time with you 
 I might bend the rules 
 'Cause I'm in love with you 
 You can see the truth 
 I will show you soon 
 Just meet me on the moon 
 She said, ""love is a strong word"" 
 Said, ""love is a strong word"" 
 Well I'mma sing it for you baby, I'll be your song bird 
 If you don't have no loving 
 How we supposed to move on, word? 
 Heard a brother just got shot 
 Because he stopped on the wrong curb 
 If love is a strong word, love is a strong word 
 Then we'll need lots of loving if we wanna move on, word 
 And I'ma sing it to you, baby, I'll be your song bird 
 But I'ma keep it honest with you 
 I won't lie to you 
 My pride dies with you 
 Girl, I love you too 
 I will see you soon 
 Your homework is due 
 (Outro - Album Version) 
 Syre, do you remember? 
 What's the difference from the future and the past 
 Just seen Batman, Lex Luther, drag racing in the jaguar 
 Started floating through the valley 
 Of the city of the angel scraping cash 
 Now I'm bleeding on the people 
 I forget that I still got an open gash 
 I'm the realest kid you never had baby 
 I won't lie to you, my pride dies with you",0.045,0.758,0.196,0.9971

 I woke up on this Sunday 
 With no motivation in my body, no-woah-woah 
 Phone drier than Mojave 
 Daddy diabetic, so he eat his pancakes with agave 
 Mamma headed to the church now 
 And she left me at the house, she left me at the house 
 Religious, but I'm lazy 
 Naked like a nudist, Fruity Loops and Stanley Kubrick 
 Peanut butter jelly, cousin bumping Makaveli 
 Sipping Stellas with my fellas 
 Bumping nothing but Fela Kuti 
 Groupies say they wanna do me 
 Truly, that feel like a blessing 
 But finding one to love is getting harder every second 
 Niggas would rather be single than see a wedding date 
 Niggas will either end up in Heaven or at Kevin's gates 
 I bench-press my problems like add another weight 
 And act like it's alright when it's not, woah 
 Some days we get Sundays, but most days the rain comes down 
 And I feel like I'm bound to drown 
 Jesus Christ, woah 
 Truth is my religion, my beliefs, and I'm forgiven 
 Some days we get Sundays, but most days the rain comes down 
 And I feel like I'm bound to drown 
 Jesus Christ, woah 
 Truth is my religion, my beliefs, and I'm forgiven 
 I've been sipping red wine since a toddler 
 Blood of Christ, sacrifice for my Father 
 My daddy love me and hate me like Mr. Focker 
 My sister happy that I can afford Supreme 
 Mama called, she said 
 ""Don't worry 'bout me baby, get your problems solved"" 
 I told her, ""Ask me for whatever, whenever you want 
 I just went double platinum"" 
 Mama say my health is more important than my album 
 I'm not loud, I'm Ethiopian rowdy 
 Send my parents to Maui, now they skin look like a brownie 
 Yo-Yo see me grind, Dimitrius say he proud 
 My niggas lift me up, whenever I'm 'bout to drown 
 Fuck a Monday, I love my Sundays 
 I head to Costco, and get a smoothie 
 Mama say count your blessings 
 So I did, and now I realize who I am and who I'm not, woah 
 Some days we get Sundays, but most days the rain comes down 
 And I feel like I'm bound to drown 
 Jesus Christ, woah 
 Truth is my religion, my beliefs, and I'm forgiven 
 Some days we get Sundays, but most days the rain comes down 
 And I feel like I'm bound to drown 
 Jesus Christ, woah 
 Truth is my religion, my beliefs, and I'm forgiven

 Petals fall from pink roses 
 And everything I thought I knew 
 I suppose is a lie

 And I'm green with envy

 The thorns are showing 
 The thorns are showing 
 The thorns are showing 
 The thorns are showing 
 But you taste best when you're in full bloom 
 Lay in my teeth, my sweet love trophy 
 You can't be killed if I rip from the roots 
 Take it with grace 
 I'm dumb and I'll chase 
 I'm young and I'll waste you away 
 I'm young and I'll waste you away 
 I'm young and I'll waste you away 
 I'm young and I'll waste you away 
 Tonight 
 If you leave me I'll flood out your fire 
 Why don't you love me like I love you like I want you like I need you 
 Everything dies 
 It's always too soon to lose to the moon 
 And you're freaking them out 
 And you look like a fool 
 And you're starting to know it 
 Your thorns are showing 
 But you taste best you when you're in full bloom 
 Lay in in my teeth, my sweet love trophy 
 You can't be killed if I rip from the roots
